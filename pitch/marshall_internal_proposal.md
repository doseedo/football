# Player Tracking & Match Simulation Platform
## Internal Proposal — Marshall University Men's Soccer

---

## Overview

This proposal outlines a pilot program to deploy AI-powered player tracking and match simulation capabilities for Marshall Men's Soccer. Using technology we can run on existing game footage, we can deliver professional-grade analytics without the $100K+ annual cost of commercial platforms.

**Proposed Pilot:** Process 5 matches to demonstrate full capabilities before committing to season-long deployment.

---

## What the Pilot Will Deliver

### For Each Match Processed

**Player Tracking Data:**
- Frame-by-frame position data for all 22 players + ball
- Individual player metrics: distance covered, top speed, sprint count
- Team-level metrics: formation shape, compactness, pressing intensity

**Tactical Analysis:**
- Heat maps showing player positioning tendencies
- Space control visualization (who dominated which zones)
- Passing lane availability throughout the match

**Exportable Outputs:**
- JSON/CSV data files for further analysis
- Annotated video with tracking overlays
- PDF summary reports for coaching staff review

### Pilot Match Selection (Recommended)

| Match | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Recent conference win | Baseline for "what works" |
| Recent conference loss | Identify areas for improvement |
| Key upcoming opponent | Tactical preparation demo |
| Top recruit's club match | Recruiting evaluation demo |
| Training scrimmage | Show practice application |

## Demo Plan

### 30-Minute Live Demo

**Agenda:**
1. **(5 min)** Quick overview of platform capabilities
2. **(15 min)** Live processing of Marshall footage — show tracking in action
3. **(5 min)** Walk through output data and reports
4. **(5 min)** Q&A and discuss pilot scope

**What We'll Show:**
- Real Marshall players being tracked automatically
- Physical metrics calculated in real-time
- Tactical visualizations generated from actual game data

**What We Need:**
- 10-15 minutes of broadcast-quality game footage
- A room with screen/projector and internet access
- Key stakeholders: Head Coach, assistants, video coordinator

## Budget Comparison

### What Commercial Solutions Cost

| Platform | Annual Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| SkillCorner | $80,000-150,000 | Pro clubs only, limited college availability |
| Second Spectrum | $100,000+ | NBA/MLS focused |
| Catapult GPS | $50,000+ | Requires wearable devices |
| Hudl Sportscode | $15,000-30,000 | Manual tagging required |

### Our Approach

| Item | Pilot Cost | Full Season |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Cloud compute | $200-400 | $10,000-18,000/year |
| Development/setup | Internal time | — |
| Maintenance | — | 2-3 hrs/week |
| **Total** | **~$500** | **~$15,000/year** |

**Savings vs. commercial:** $65,000-135,000 annually
