# Player Tracking & Match Simulation Platform
## Proposal for Marshall University Men's Soccer

---

## Executive Summary

We are proposing a partnership with Marshall University Men's Soccer to deploy an advanced AI-powered player tracking and match simulation platform. This system transforms standard broadcast footage into actionable performance intelligence—giving your coaching staff the same analytical capabilities used by elite professional clubs, without the prohibitive costs.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete 22-player tracking with physical performance metrics
- Tactical analysis and opponent preparation tools
- Match simulation engine for scenario planning
- Custom player development dashboards

---

## The Challenge

Modern soccer success depends on data-driven decisions. Elite clubs leverage platforms like SkillCorner and Second Spectrum, but these solutions cost **$50,000-$200,000+ annually**—putting them out of reach for most collegiate programs.

**Marshall's Opportunity:** Gain a competitive edge in recruiting, match preparation, and player development by accessing professional-grade analytics at a fraction of the cost.

## Our Solution

### 1. Automated Player Tracking

Our AI system processes any broadcast or training footage and outputs comprehensive tracking data:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Position Data** | Frame-by-frame X/Y coordinates for all 22 players + ball |
| **Speed & Distance** | Real-time velocity, total distance covered per player |
| **Sprint Analysis** | High-intensity runs (>25 km/h), sprint count, recovery patterns |
| **Acceleration** | Explosive movements, deceleration patterns |
| **Heat Maps** | Positional tendencies and zone coverage |

**Technical Highlights:**
- **No manual calibration required** — AI automatically detects pitch landmarks
- **Jersey number recognition** — Identifies individual players automatically
- **Works with existing footage** — Process game film you already have
- **Real-time capable** — Live analysis during matches or training

### 2. Tactical Intelligence Engine

Our Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes team formations and movement patterns to deliver:

**Team-Level Metrics:**
- Defensive line height and compactness
- Team length and width during possession phases
- Pressing intensity and trigger zones
- Transition speed (defense → attack)

**Space Control Analysis:**
- Pitch control percentage (who dominates which zones)
- Passing lane availability
- Pressure on ball carriers
- Expected Threat (xT) from player positions

**Opponent Scouting:**
- Identify tactical tendencies from opponent film
- Detect defensive vulnerabilities
- Map high-pressure zones and pressing triggers
- Analyze set-piece positioning

### 3. Match Simulation Platform

Our simulation engine allows coaching staff to:

**"What If" Scenario Planning:**
- Test formation changes against specific opponents
- Simulate pressing strategies and predict outcomes
- Analyze how player substitutions affect team dynamics
- Model optimal positioning for set pieces

**Player Role Simulation:**
- Project how a recruit would fit your system
- Test tactical adjustments before match day
- Train players on positional responsibilities via visual scenarios

**Powered by:**
- Baller2Vec++ transformer architecture for movement prediction
- Physics-constrained modeling (realistic speed/acceleration limits)
- Trained on professional match data for accurate predictions

### 4. Player Development Dashboard

Individual player profiles with:

- **Physical Load Monitoring** — Track distance, sprints, high-intensity minutes
- **Positional Performance** — Zone-by-zone effectiveness ratings
- **Trend Analysis** — Performance changes over the season
- **Benchmark Comparisons** — How players compare to positional standards
- **Injury Risk Indicators** — Flag overtraining or fatigue patterns

## Use Cases for Marshall Soccer

### Match Preparation
> *"Next week's opponent consistently presses high when their left back pushes forward. Our simulation shows a 3-pass sequence to exploit the space behind him."*

- Analyze opponent film to identify patterns
- Build tactical game plans with visual evidence
- Present data-driven scenarios in team meetings

### Recruiting Edge
> *"We tracked this prospect's off-ball movement and compared it to our current roster. His work rate and positioning fit perfectly in our system."*

- Evaluate recruits using objective metrics
- Compare prospect data to current player benchmarks
- Build compelling data packages for recruiting presentations

### Training Optimization
> *"Sprint data shows players are fatiguing in the 70th minute. We adjusted conditioning to target that window."*

- Monitor training loads to prevent injuries
- Identify fitness gaps in specific players
- Track progress through measurable improvements

### In-Game Adjustments
> *"Real-time data shows our right side is getting overloaded. Tactical analysis suggests pushing our #8 wider."*

- Process footage during halftime for tactical insights
- Identify issues while the game is still winnable
- Make substitutions based on physical data (who has gas left)
