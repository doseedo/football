## Attacking Analysis

### Build-Up Patterns

**Primary Pattern (62% of attacks):**
```
GK → CB → Wide → Overlap → Cross

Observation: Prefer building down LEFT side
Left-sided attacks: 58%
Right-sided attacks: 32%
Central attacks: 10%
```

**Key Attackers:**

| # | Name | Position | Threat Level | Notes |
|---|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| 9 | [Name] | ST | HIGH | 1.2 xG/match, excellent movement |
| 11 | [Name] | LW | HIGH | Primary creator, 3.4 key passes/match |
| 7 | [Name] | RW | MEDIUM | Pace threat, limited end product |

### Transition Threat

| Metric | Value | Concern Level |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Counter Speed | 3.8s avg | HIGH |
| Counter Success | 34% | MEDIUM |
| Players Committed | 4.2 avg | HIGH |

**Note:** They are dangerous on the counter. #9 and #11 stay high — don't overcommit.

---

## Defensive Analysis

### Structure

| Metric | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Defensive Line | 38m | LOW block — space behind is limited |
| Compactness | 32m | STRETCHED — gaps between lines |
| Width | 42m | Narrow — wide areas vulnerable |

### Pressing Behavior

```
PRESSING TRIGGER ZONES

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │
│        ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓               │  ← HIGH PRESS ZONE
│        ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓               │    (When GK/CB has ball)
│                                 │
│                                 │
│    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░           │  ← MID BLOCK
│    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░           │    (Primary defensive shape)
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Pressing Intensity: 0.58 (BELOW AVG)
Press Duration: 4.2s avg (SHORT)
```

**Key Finding:** They press for ~4 seconds then drop into mid-block. Be patient in build-up — the press will stop.

### Defensive Vulnerabilities

1. **Channel Between CB and RB**
   - RB pushes high in attack
   - Slow to recover (2.1s avg)
   - Space available in transition

2. **Set Pieces**
   - Concede 0.8 goals/match from set pieces (HIGH)
   - Zone marking on corners — target back post
   - Weak aerial presence from #4

3. **Late-Game Fatigue**
   - Defensive line drops to 32m after 70 min
   - Compactness worsens by 18%
   - Best window: 70-80 min

---

## Key Player Scouting

### #9 — [Striker Name]

```
THREAT LEVEL: ████████████████████ HIGH

Movement: Excellent runs behind, anticipates through balls
Aerial: 62% duel win rate
Weakness: Poor defensive contribution, loses ball under pressure
```

**Recommendation:** Don't let him turn. Force him to receive facing his goal. Our CB should be tight, no space between.

### #6 — [Defensive Mid Name]

```
THREAT LEVEL: ██████████░░░░░░░░░░ MEDIUM

Role: Shield for back 4, initiates build-up
Strength: Positional discipline, reading passes
Weakness: Slow to cover wide areas, 1v1 defending
```

**Recommendation:** Pull him wide with our wingers. Creates central space for our #10.

## Game Plan Recommendations

### When We Have the Ball

| Situation | Recommendation | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Build-up | Be patient, play through press | Press lasts only 4s |
| Attacking | Target RIGHT side | Their RB is slow to recover |
| Final Third | Early crosses to back post | Weak aerial defending |
| Set Pieces | Target #4's zone | Aerial weakness |

### When They Have the Ball

| Situation | Recommendation | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Their build-up | Press LEFT CB | They build down left |
| Mid-block | Compact, protect central channel | #9 wants through balls |
| Transition | NO OVERCOMMITS | Counter threat is real |
| Wide areas | Force inside | Their wingers need space |

### Substitution Window

**Target: 70-80 minutes**
- Their fitness drops significantly
- Push higher, increase tempo
- Fresh legs can exploit space

---

## Set Piece Analysis

### Their Corners (Attacking)

```
DELIVERY: Inswinging to near post (78%)
TARGET: #4, #9 (tallest)
WEAKNESS: Back post coverage is poor

RECOMMENDATION:
- Zonal at near post
- Man mark #4 and #9
- Free player at back post
```

### Their Corners (Defending)

```
SETUP: Zonal marking
WEAKNESS: Back post zone undermanned

RECOMMENDATION:
- Target back post with #4
- Decoy run to near post
- Short corner option if zone collapses
```

---

## Summary: Top 5 Tactical Points

1. **Be patient in build-up** — their press dies after 4 seconds
2. **Attack down the right** — their RB is vulnerable
3. **Don't overcommit** — counter attack is their best weapon
4. **Exploit back post** — aerial weakness on set pieces
5. **Push after 70 min** — they fade physically
